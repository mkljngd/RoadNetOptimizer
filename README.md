# Project Overview
The project develops a route optimization system that integrates Java and Python to efficiently compute and visualize routes within a graph representing California's road network. The Java component features a `GraphBuilder` that uses the Builder pattern for flexible graph construction and a `RoadNetworkLoader` for parsing data from the `roadNet-CA.txt` file into a usable graph format. Route calculation is handled through `DijkstraStrategy` and `BellmanFordStrategy`, employing the Strategy pattern to enable algorithm interchangeability based on performance needs. The system also includes a `RouteCalculationExecutor` to manage route computations concurrently via a thread pool, and a `RouteOptimizationFacade` that simplifies backend interactions for clients.

On the Python side, the project uses `NetworkX` and `Matplotlib` for visualizing routes and graph structures, enhancing understanding and analysis of the routing algorithmsâ€™ effectiveness. This dual-component approach not only ensures robust processing and route optimization across a complex network but also provides critical visual insights useful for debugging, analysis, and demonstrating algorithm efficacy in practical scenarios. This integrated system aims to optimize route planning in urban planning, logistics, and transportation management, offering significant improvements in route efficiency and resource management.

# Implementation Description 


## Flexibility
- **Builder Pattern (`GraphBuilder`)**: Allows easy extension for different types of nodes or edges, supporting step-by-step graph construction.
- **Strategy Pattern (`RouteStrategy`)**: Facilitates the addition of new routing algorithms by implementing the `RouteStrategy` interface, enhancing algorithm interchangeability without modifying existing code.
- **Facade Pattern (`RouteOptimizationFacade`)**: Simplifies backend modifications (like adding new components) without changing how clients interact with the system.


## Simplicity and Understandability
- **Facade Pattern**: Offers a simple interface to complex systems, improving the readability and maintainability of client interactions.
- **Singleton Pattern (`RouteOptimizationApp`)**: Ensures a single access point, simplifying management and preventing resource conflicts.
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each class has a defined role, enhancing the code's readability and ease of maintenance.


## Avoidance of Duplicated Code
- **Strategy Pattern**: Abstracts common functionalities in routing algorithms, preventing code duplication across implementations.
- **Builder Pattern (`GraphBuilder`)**: Centralizes graph construction tasks, eliminating repetitive code.
- **Importance**: Reduces bugs, enhances readability, and simplifies future modifications.


## Design Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Used to decouple system complexity from user interactions, making the system user-friendly.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Controls application lifecycle and resource management, crucial for applications with significant shared resources.
- **Builder Pattern**: Manages complex graph constructions incrementally, improving code manageability.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows flexibility in swapping routing algorithms, facilitating easy system extension.
- **Thread Pool Pattern (`RouteCalculationExecutor`)**: Manages concurrent execution of tasks using a fixed number of threads, optimizing resource usage and enhancing performance.


# Maven Commands

We'll use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. You'll need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) on your system. 

Apache Maven is a build automation tool and a project management tool for Java-based projects. Maven provides a standardized way to build, package, and deploy Java applications.

Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file to manage the build process and its dependencies. The POM file contains information about the project, such as its dependencies, the build configuration, and the plugins used for building and packaging the project.

Maven provides a centralized repository for storing and accessing dependencies, which makes it easier to manage the dependencies of a project. It also provides a standardized way to build and deploy projects, which helps to ensure that builds are consistent and repeatable.

Maven also integrates with other development tools, such as IDEs and continuous integration systems, making it easier to use as part of a development workflow.

Maven provides a large number of plugins for various tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, generating reports, and creating JAR files. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used for many different types of Java projects.

## Compile
Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```



## JUnit Tests
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java. JUnit tests are automated tests that are written to verify that the behavior of a piece of code is as expected.

In JUnit, tests are written as methods within a test class. Each test method tests a specific aspect of the code and is annotated with the @Test annotation. JUnit provides a range of assertions that can be used to verify the behavior of the code being tested.

JUnit tests are executed automatically and the results of the tests are reported. This allows developers to quickly and easily check if their code is working as expected, and make any necessary changes to fix any issues that are found.

The use of JUnit tests is an important part of Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the code they are testing is written. This helps to ensure that the code is written in a way that is easily testable and that all required functionality is covered by tests.

JUnit tests can be run as part of a continuous integration pipeline, where tests are automatically run every time changes are made to the code. This helps to catch any issues as soon as they are introduced, reducing the need for manual testing and making it easier to ensure that the code is always in a releasable state.

To run, use the following command:
```bash
mvn clean test
```


## Spotbugs 

SpotBugs is a static code analysis tool for Java that detects potential bugs in your code. It is an open-source tool that can be used as a standalone application or integrated into development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Gradle.

SpotBugs performs an analysis of the bytecode generated from your Java source code and reports on any potential problems or issues that it finds. This includes things like null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, misused collections, and other common bugs.

The tool uses data flow analysis to examine the behavior of the code and detect issues that might not be immediately obvious from just reading the source code. SpotBugs is able to identify a wide range of issues and can be customized to meet the needs of your specific project.

Using SpotBugs can help to improve the quality and reliability of your code by catching potential bugs early in the development process. This can save time and effort in the long run by reducing the need for debugging and fixing issues later in the development cycle. SpotBugs can also help to ensure that your code is secure by identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

Use the following command:

```bash
mvn spotbugs:gui 
```

SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


## Checkstyle 

Checkstyle is a development tool for checking Java source code against a set of coding standards. It is an open-source tool that can be integrated into various integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse and IntelliJ, as well as build tools like Maven and Gradle.

Checkstyle performs static code analysis, which means it examines the source code without executing it, and reports on any issues or violations of the coding standards defined in its configuration. This includes issues like code style, code indentation, naming conventions, code structure, and many others.

By using Checkstyle, developers can ensure that their code adheres to a consistent style and follows best practices, making it easier for other developers to read and maintain. It can also help to identify potential issues before the code is actually run, reducing the risk of runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Checkstyle is highly configurable and can be customized to fit the needs of your team or organization. It supports a wide range of coding standards and can be integrated with other tools, such as code coverage and automated testing tools, to create a comprehensive and automated software development process.

The following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open in a web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```
